## ECE1512 â€“ Project A: Visual Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks

In this report, we use two datasets, MNIST1D and HMT, to learn how to interpret image classification models using interpretable artificial intelligence methods (XAI). The three methods are LIME (one of the approximation-based methods), Integrated Gradient (one of the backpropagation-based methods) and Grad-CAM (one of the CAM-based methods). We show the interpretation graphs obtained by the three methods and report qualitatively on these three methods.
